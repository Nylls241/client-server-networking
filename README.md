# TCP and UDP Client-Server Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic TCP and UDP client-server communication in Python. It includes both TCP and UDP servers and clients, and provides a comparison between the two protocols.

## Introduction

This project is designed to help understand the differences between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) by implementing simple client-server applications for both protocols. The project includes:

1. A TCP server and client.
2. A UDP server and client.
3. Scenarios to compare the performance and behavior of TCP and UDP.

## Features

- TCP Server: Listens for incoming connections and echoes received messages.
- TCP Client: Connects to the TCP server and exchanges messages.
- UDP Server: Listens for incoming messages and echoes them back.
- UDP Client: Sends messages to the UDP server and receives responses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tcp-udp-client-server.git
   cd tcp-udp-client-server
